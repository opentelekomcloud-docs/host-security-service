Vulnerability Scan
==================

HSS can scan for Linux, Windows, Web-CMS, and application vulnerabilities. Automatic, scheduled (vulnerability policy configuration), and manual scans are supported.

-  Automatic scan

   When collecting asset fingerprints, HSS automatically scans vulnerabilities. For Linux, Windows, and Web-CMS vulnerabilities, HSS scans them based on the software collection period. For application vulnerabilities, HSS scans them based on the middleware collection period. For details about the asset fingerprint collection period, see :ref:`Collecting Server Asset Fingerprints <hss_01_0477>`.

   If vulnerabilities have been manually scanned or a scheduled vulnerability scanning task has been triggered within the asset fingerprint collection period, HSS will automatically scan vulnerabilities when collecting asset fingerprints next time. This collection mode is affected by the other two scanning modes, and the scanning period is not fixed. You are advised to use the other two scan methods.

-  Scheduled scan

   By default, HSS performs a full server vulnerability scan once a week. To ensure service security, you are advised to set a proper scan period and scan server scope to periodically scan server vulnerabilities.

-  Manual scan

   If you want to view the vulnerability fixing status or real-time vulnerabilities of a server, you are advised to manually scan for vulnerabilities.

This section describes how to manually scan for vulnerabilities and configure a scheduled scan policy.

Constraints
-----------

-  If the agent version of the Windows OS is 4.0.18 or later, application vulnerability scan is supported.

-  The **Server Status** is **Running**, **Agent Status** is **Online**, and **Protection Status** is **Protected**. Otherwise, vulnerability scan cannot be performed.

-  For details about the types of vulnerabilities that can be scanned by different HSS editions, see :ref:`Types of Vulnerabilities That Can Be Scanned and Fixed <hss_01_0302__section9935230153717>`.

-  For details about the OSs supported, see :ref:`Table 1 <hss_01_0412__hss_01_0302_table1796232221619>`.

   Click the number next to the red figure in the **Scan Result** column to view information about the servers that fail to be scanned.

   .. note::

      You can also choose **Asset Management** > **Servers & Quota** and scan a single server for vulnerabilities on the **Servers** tab. The procedure is as follows:

      a. Click a server name.
      b. Choose **Vulnerabilities**.
      c. Choose the vulnerability type to be scanned and click **Scan**.
