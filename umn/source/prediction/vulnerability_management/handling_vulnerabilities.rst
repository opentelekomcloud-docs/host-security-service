Handling Vulnerabilities
========================

If HSS detects a vulnerability on a server, you need to handle the vulnerability in a timely manner based on its severity and your business conditions to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited by intruders.

Vulnerabilities can be handled in the following ways:

-  **Fixing vulnerabilities**

   If a vulnerability may harm your services, fix it as soon as possible. For Linux and Windows vulnerabilities, you can let HSS fix them in one-click. Web-CMS vulnerabilities, emergency vulnerabilities, and application vulnerabilities cannot be automatically fixed. Handle them by referring to the suggestions provided on the vulnerability details page.

-  **Ignoring vulnerabilities**

   Some vulnerabilities are risky only in specific conditions. For example, if a vulnerability can be exploited only through an open port, but the target server does not open any ports, the vulnerability will not harm the server. If you can confirm that a vulnerability is harmless, you can ignore it.

Constraints

-  The kernel vulnerabilities on CCE, MRS, and BMS servers cannot be fixed. Fixing them may make some functions unavailable.

-  To handle vulnerabilities on a server, ensure the server is in the **Running** state, its agent status is **Online**, and its protection status is **Protected**.

Precautions
-----------

-  Vulnerability fixing operations cannot be rolled back. If a vulnerability fails to be fixed, services will probably be interrupted, and incompatibility issues will probably occur in middleware or upper layer applications. To prevent unexpected consequences, you are advised to use CBR to back up ECSs. Then, use idle servers to simulate the production environment and test-fix the vulnerability. If the test-fix succeeds, fix the vulnerability on servers running in the production environment.
-  Servers need to access the Internet and use external image sources to fix vulnerabilities.

Urgency
-------

-  **High**: This vulnerability must be fixed as soon as possible. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to damage the server.
-  **Medium**: You are advised to fix the vulnerability to enhance your server security.
-  **Safe for now**: This vulnerability has a small threat to server security. You can choose to fix or ignore it.

Vulnerability Fix Priority
--------------------------

Vulnerabilities detected by HSS are classified into four priority levels: critical, high, medium, and low. You can refer to the priorities to fix the vulnerabilities that have significant impact on your server first.

-  **Critical**: This vulnerability must be fixed immediately. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to cause great damage to the server.
-  **High**: This vulnerability must be fixed as soon as possible. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to damage the server.
-  **Medium**: You are advised to fix the vulnerability to enhance your server security.
-  **Low**: This vulnerability has a small threat to server security. You can choose to fix or ignore it.

Vulnerability Display
---------------------

Detected vulnerabilities will be displayed in the vulnerability list for seven days, regardless of whether you have handled them.

Manually Fixing Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------

HSS cannot automatically fix Web-CMS vulnerabilities, application vulnerabilities, and emergency vulnerabilities in one click. You can log in to the server to manually fix them by referring to the fix suggestions on the vulnerability details slide-out panel.

.. note::

   -  Restart the system after you fixed a Windows OS or Linux kernel vulnerability, or HSS will probably continue to warn you of this vulnerability.
   -  Fix the vulnerabilities in sequence based on the suggestions.
   -  If multiple software packages on the same server have the same vulnerability, you only need to fix the vulnerability once.

**Viewing vulnerability fix suggestions**

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**.
#. Click the name of a target vulnerability to access the vulnerability details slide-out panel and view the fix suggestions.

**Fixing vulnerabilities by referring to vulnerability fix suggestions**

Vulnerability fix may affect service stability. You are advised to use either of the following methods to avoid such impact:

-  Method 1: Create a new VM to fix the vulnerability.

   #. Create an image for the ECS to be fixed.
   #. Use the image to create an ECS.
   #. Fix the vulnerability on the new ECS and verify the result.
   #. Switch services over to the new ECS and verify they are stably running.
   #. Release the original ECS. If a fault occurs after the service switchover and cannot be rectified, you can switch services back to the original ECS.

-  Method 2: Fix the vulnerability on the target server.

   #. Create a backup for the ECS whose vulnerabilities need to be fixed.
   #. Fix vulnerabilities on the current server.
   #. If services become unavailable after the vulnerability is fixed and cannot be recovered in a timely manner, use the backup to restore the server.

   .. note::

      -  Use method 1 if you are fixing a vulnerability for the first time and cannot estimate impact on services. In this way, you can release the ECS at any time to save costs if the vulnerability fails to be fixed.
      -  Use method 2 if you have fixed the vulnerability on similar servers before.

Ignoring a Vulnerability
------------------------

Some vulnerabilities are risky only in specific conditions. For example, if a vulnerability can be exploited only through an open port, but the target server does not open any ports, the vulnerability will not harm the server. Such vulnerabilities can be ignored. HSS will not generate alarms for ignored vulnerabilities.

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**.
#. Locate the row containing a target vulnerability and click **Ignore** in the **Operation** column.
#. In the dialog box displayed, click **OK**.

Whitelisting Vulnerabilities
----------------------------

If you evaluate that some vulnerabilities do not affect your services and do not want to view the vulnerabilities in the vulnerability list, you can whitelist the vulnerabilities. After they are whitelisted, the vulnerabilities will be ignored in the vulnerability list and no alarms will be reported. The vulnerabilities will not be scanned and the vulnerability information will not be displayed when the next vulnerability scan task is executed.

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**.

   -  Whitelisting all servers that are affected by a vulnerability

      HSS will ignore the vulnerability when scanning for vulnerabilities on all servers.

      a. In the **Operation** column of the row containing the target vulnerability, click **More** and select **Add to Whitelist**.

         You can also select multiple vulnerabilities and click **Add to Whitelist** above the vulnerability list.

Verifying the Vulnerability Fix
-------------------------------

After you manually fix vulnerabilities, you are advised to verify the fixing result.

-  **Method 1**: On the vulnerability details page, click **Verify** to perform one-click verification.

   .. note::

      -  The fixing of emergency vulnerabilities cannot be verified.
      -  Only application vulnerabilities of the JAR package can be verified. Application vulnerabilities of the non-JAR package are automatically filtered out and not verified.

-  **Method 2**: Ensure the software has been upgraded to the latest version. The following table provides the commands to check the software upgrade result.

   .. table:: **Table 5** Verification commands
