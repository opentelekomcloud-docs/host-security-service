Managing the Vulnerability Whitelist
====================================

If you evaluate that some vulnerabilities do not affect your services and do not want to view the vulnerabilities in the vulnerability list, you can whitelist the vulnerabilities. After they are whitelisted, the vulnerabilities will be ignored in the vulnerability list and no alarms will be reported. The vulnerabilities will not be scanned and the vulnerability information will not be displayed when the next vulnerability scan task is executed.

This section describes how to modify and remove an item in the vulnerability whitelist.

#. Log in to the management console.

2. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**.

3. In the upper right corner of the **Vulnerabilities** page, click **Configure Policy**.

4. In the row containing the desired vulnerability whitelist rule, click **Edit** in the **Operation** column.
5. On the editing page, modify the information and click **OK**.
