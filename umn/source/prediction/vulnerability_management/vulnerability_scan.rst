Vulnerability Scan
==================

HSS can scan for Linux, Windows, Web-CMS, application, and emergency vulnerabilities. Automatic, scheduled, and manual scans are supported.

-  Automatic scan

   By default, Linux, Windows, and Web-CMS vulnerabilities are automatically scanned every day. Application vulnerabilities are automatically scanned every Monday. The time of an automatic application vulnerability scan changes with the middleware asset scan time. For details about how to view and set the latter, see :ref:`Asset Discovery <hss_01_0044__section1219861342>`.

   If a manual or scheduled vulnerability scan has been performed in a day, HSS will not automatically scan for vulnerabilities on that day.

-  Scheduled scan

   By default, a full server vulnerability scan is performed once a week. To protect workloads, you are advised to set a proper scan period and scan server scope to periodically scan server vulnerabilities.

-  Manual scan

   If you want to view the vulnerability fixing status or real-time vulnerabilities of a server, you are advised to manually scan for vulnerabilities.

This section describes how to manually scan for vulnerabilities and configure a scheduled scan policy.

Constraints
-----------

-  If the agent version of the Windows OS is 4.0.18 or later, application vulnerability scan is supported.

-  The **Server Status** is **Running**, **Agent Status** is **Online**, and **Protection Status** is **Protected**. Otherwise, vulnerability scan cannot be performed.

-  For details about the types of vulnerabilities that can be scanned by different HSS editions, see :ref:`Types of Vulnerabilities That Can Be Scanned and Fixed <hss_01_0302__section9935230153717>`.

-  For details about the OSs supported, see :ref:`Table 1 <hss_01_0412__hss_01_0302_table1796232221619>`.
