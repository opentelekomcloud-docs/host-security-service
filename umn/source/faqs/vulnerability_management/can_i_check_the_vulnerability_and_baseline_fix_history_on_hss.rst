Can I Check the Vulnerability and Baseline Fix History on HSS?
==============================================================

Viewing Fixed Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**.
#. On the vulnerability tabs, filter and view fixed vulnerabilities.

   .. important::

      Vulnerabilities are displayed in the vulnerability list only for seven days. You can only check the vulnerabilities that have been fixed in the last seven days.

Viewing Fixed Baseline Issues
-----------------------------

The fix history does not show the password complexity policy settings or common weak passwords that have been fixed. To check other fixed configuration items, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the management console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Baseline Checks**.
#. Click the **Unsafe Configurations** tab.
#. Click a baseline name to go to the details page.
#. On the **Check Items** tab, view the check items in **Passed** state.
