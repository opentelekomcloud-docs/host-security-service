=============================

Procedure
---------

#. Check the vulnerability detection results.
#. Based on provided solutions, fix vulnerabilities one by one in descending order by severity.

   -  Restart the Windows OS after you fix its vulnerabilities.
   -  Restart the Linux OS after you fix its kernel vulnerabilities.

#. HSS scans all Linux servers, Windows servers, and Web-CMS servers for vulnerabilities every early morning. After you fix the vulnerabilities, you are advised to perform a check immediately to verify the result.
