What Do I Do If an Alarm Still Exists After I Fixed a Vulnerability?
====================================================================

Perform the following operations to locate the cause and fix the problems.

.. note::

   For more information, see the section "Handling Vulnerabilities".

Possible Causes and Solutions on a Linux Server
-----------------------------------------------

-  No yum sources have been configured.

   In this case, configure a yum source suitable for your Linux OS, and fix the vulnerability again.

-  The yum source does not have the latest upgrade package of the corresponding software.

   Switch to the yum source having the required package and fix the vulnerability again.

-  The intranet environment cannot connect to Internet.

   Servers need to access the Internet and use external yum sources to fix vulnerabilities. If your servers cannot access the Internet, or the external image sources cannot provide stable services, you can use the image source.

-  The old kernel version remains.

   Old kernel versions often remain in servers after upgrade. You can run the :ref:`verification commands <hss_01_0176__table1431544555412>` to check whether the current kernel version meets the vulnerability fix requirements. If it does, ignore the vulnerability on the **Linux Vulnerabilities** tab of the **Vulnerabilities** page. You are not advised to delete the old kernel.

      ================================== ===============================
      OS                                 Verification Command
      ================================== ===============================
      CentOS/Fedora /Euler/Redhat/Oracle rpm -qa \| grep *Software_name*
      Debian/Ubuntu                      dpkg -l \| grep *Software_name*
      Gentoo                             emerge --search *Software_name*
      ================================== ===============================

-  **The server is not restarted after the kernel vulnerability is fixed.**

   After the kernel vulnerability is fixed, restart the server. If the server is not restarted, the vulnerability alarm still exists.
