Why Can't I Select a Server During Manual Vulnerability Scanning or Batch Vulnerability Fixing?
===============================================================================================

Possible Causes
---------------

During manual vulnerability scanning or batch vulnerability fixing, the following servers cannot be selected:

-  Servers that are not in the **Running** state
-  Servers whose agent status is **Offline**

Solution
--------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner of the page, select a region, and choose **Security** > **Host Security Service**. The HSS page is displayed.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Asset Management** > **Servers & Quota**.

#. On the **Servers** tab, view the server running status, agent status, and HSS version.

   Confirm related information and perform the following operations to rectify the fault:

   -  Servers that are not in the **Running** state

      Check the server and ensure the server status is **Running**.

   -  Servers whose agent status is **Offline**

      An offline agent cannot receive instructions delivered from the console. To put the agent back online, perform the operations described in :ref:`How Do I Fix an Abnormal Agent? <hss_01_0036>`

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Prediction** > **Vulnerabilities**. Select the servers you want to manually scan or fix in batches again. If the target server can be selected, the problem has been fixed.
