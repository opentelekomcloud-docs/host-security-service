How Often Is Malware Scan and Removal?
======================================

Detection period: real-time detection

Isolation and killing period:

-  If you have enabled automatic isolation and killing, the system will scan and kill viruses in real time.
-  If you have not enabled automatic isolation and killing, you need to manually check and handle alarms.

.. important::

   #. HSS can detect malicious programs (through cloud-based antivirus) and abnormal process behaviors in real time, report alarms, and isolate and kill them. For details about the detection capabilities, see "Features".
   #. HSS isolation and killing can be automatically or manually performed.

      -  For more information about automatic isolation and killing, see "Isolating and Killing Malicious Programs" in "Security Configuration".
      -  For more information about manual isolation and killing, see "Isolating and Killing Files" in "Managing Isolated Files".
