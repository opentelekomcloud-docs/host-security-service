How Do I Set a Secure Password?
===============================

Comply with the following rules:

-  Use a password with high complexity.

   The password must meet the following requirements:

   #. Contains at least eight characters.
   #. Contain at least three types of the following characters:

      a. Uppercase letters (A-Z)
      b. Lowercase letters (a-z)
      c. Digital (0-9)
      d. Special characters

   #. The password cannot be the username or the username in reverse order.

-  Do not use common weak passwords that are easy to crack, including:

   -  Birthday, name, ID card, mobile number, email address, user ID, time, or date
   -  Consecutive digits and letters, adjacent keyboard characters, or passwords in rainbow tables
   -  Phrases
   -  Common words, such as company names, **admin**, and **root**

-  Do not use empty or default passwords.

-  Do not reuse the latest five passwords you used.

-  Use different passwords for different websites and accounts.

-  Do not use the same pair of username and password for multiple systems.

-  Change your password at least once every 90 days.

-  If an account has an initial password, force the user to change the password upon first login or within a limited period of time.

-  You are advised to set a locking policy for all accounts. If the consecutive login failures of an account exceed five times, the account will be locked, and will be automatically unlocked in 30 minutes.

-  You are advised to set a logout policy. Accounts that have been inactive for more than 10 minutes will be automatically logged out or locked.

-  You are advised to force users to change the initial passwords of their accounts upon their first login.

-  You are advised to retain account login logs for at least 180 days. The logs cannot contain user passwords.
