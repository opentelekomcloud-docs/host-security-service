How Do I View Servers Where No Agents Have Been Installed?
==========================================================

#. Log in to the management console.

#. On the **Installation & Configuration** page, click the **Agents** tab and click **Offline**. View the servers where the agent is not installed.

   Possible agent statuses are:

   -  **Not installed**: The agent has not been installed or successfully started.

   -  **Online**: The agent is running properly.

   -  **Offline**: The communication between the agent and the HSS server is abnormal, and HSS cannot protect your servers.

      Click **Offline Cause** to view the possible causes.
