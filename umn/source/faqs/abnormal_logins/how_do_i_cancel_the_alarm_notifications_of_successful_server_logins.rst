How Do I Cancel the Alarm Notifications of Successful Server Logins?
====================================================================

-  If you select **Successful Logins** in the **Real-Time Alarm Notifications** area, HSS will send alarms when detecting any successful logins.
-  If all the accounts on your ECSs are managed by a single administrator, such alarms help them conveniently monitor system accounts.
-  If the system accounts are managed by multiple administrators, or different servers are managed by different administrators, too many alarms will interrupt O&M personnel. In this case, you are advised to disable the alarm item.
-  Alarms on this event do not necessarily indicate attacks. Logins from valid IP addresses are not attacks.
