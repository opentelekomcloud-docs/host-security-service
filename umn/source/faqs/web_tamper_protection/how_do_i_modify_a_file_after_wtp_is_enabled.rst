How Do I Modify a File After WTP Is Enabled?
============================================

Protected directories are read-only. To modify files or update the website, perform any of the following operations.

Temporarily Disabling WTP
-------------------------

Disable WTP while you modify files in protected directories.

Your website is not protected from tampering while WTP is disabled. Enable it immediately after updating your website.

Setting Scheduled Protection
----------------------------

You can set periodic static WTP, and update websites while WTP is automatically disabled.

Exercise caution when you set the periods to disable WTP, because files will not be protected in those periods.
