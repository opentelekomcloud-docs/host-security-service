Why Some Attacks on Servers Are Not Detected?
=============================================

-  Intrusions to your servers before HSS is enabled cannot be detected.
-  If you have applied for HSS, remember to enable it to detect intrusions.
-  Web attacks cannot be detected, because HSS mainly defends your servers. To protect websites, you can consult the security Solution Architect or use other secure services (such as WAF and Anti-DDoS).
