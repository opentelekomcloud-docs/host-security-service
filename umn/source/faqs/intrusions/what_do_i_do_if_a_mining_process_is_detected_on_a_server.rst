What Do I Do If a Mining Process Is Detected on a Server?
=========================================================

You are advised to:

#. Back up data and disable unnecessary ports.
#. Set a stronger server password.
#. Enable HSS. Your servers will be protected from mining processes by its intrusion detection functions, such as account cracking prevention, remote login detection, malicious program detection, and web shell detection; as well as malicious program killing and vulnerability fixing functions.
