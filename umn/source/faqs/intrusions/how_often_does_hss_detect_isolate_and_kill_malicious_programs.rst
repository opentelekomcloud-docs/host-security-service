How Often Does HSS Detect, Isolate, and Kill Malicious Programs?
================================================================

Detection period: real-time detection

Isolation and killing period:

-  If you have enabled automatic isolation and killing, the system will scan and kill viruses in real time.
-  If you have not enabled automatic isolation and killing, you need to manually check and handle alarms.

.. important::

   #. HSS can detect, isolate and kill malicious programs (by cloud scan) and abnormal process behaviors. For more information, see Editions.
   #. HSS isolation and killing can be automatically or manually performed.

      -  For more information about automatic isolation and killing, see "Isolating and Killing Malicious Programs" in "Security Configuration".
      -  For more information about manual isolation and killing, see "Isolating and Killing Files" in "Managing Isolated Files".
