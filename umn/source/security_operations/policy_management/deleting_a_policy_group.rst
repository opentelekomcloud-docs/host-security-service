Deleting a Policy Group
=======================

Preset policy groups cannot be deleted. You can delete custom policy groups of premium and container editions.

Constraints
-----------

After a policy group is deleted, the **Policy Group** column of the servers that were associated with the group will be blank. You need to deploy a policy group for a server again by referring to :ref:`Deploying a Protection Policy <hss_01_0024>`.
