Free Scan
=========

Servers that are not protected by HSS are scanned for free. A security report on their vulnerabilities, unsafe passwords, and asset risks will be generated.


Free Scan
---------

-  ECSs that are not protected by HSS are scanned for free at 05:00 in the early morning on the first day of each month.
-  In a free server check report, up to five results can be displayed for each check item. If a check item has fewer than five results, only half of them will be displayed.
-  A free health check report is generated on the first day of each month. You can only view the report online but cannot download it.
