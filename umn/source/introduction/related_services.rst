SWR provides easy, secure, and reliable management over container images throughout their lifecycles, facilitating the deployment of containerized services. For more information, see the *Software Repository for Container User Guide*. HSS scans for vulnerabilities and configurations in container images to help you detect the container environment that cannot be achieved by traditional security software.
