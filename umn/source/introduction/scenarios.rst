Scenarios
=========

HSS
---

-  Centralized security management

   With HSS, you can manage the security configurations and events of all your cloud servers on the console, reducing risks and management costs.

-  Security risk evaluation

   You can check and eliminate all the risks (such as risky accounts, open ports, software vulnerabilities, and weak passwords) on your servers.

-  Account protection

   Take advantage of comprehensive account security capabilities, including prevention, anti-attack, and post-attack scan. You can use 2FA to block brute-force attacks on accounts, enhancing the security of your cloud servers.

-  Proactive security

   Count and scan your server assets, check and fix vulnerabilities and unsafe settings, and proactively protect your network, applications, and files from attacks.

-  Intrusion detection

   Scan all possible attack vectors to detect and fight advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other threats in real time, protecting your system from their impact.

CGS
---

-  Container image security

   Vulnerabilities will probably be introduced to your system through the images downloaded from Docker Hub or through open-source frameworks.

   You can use CGS to scan images for risks, including image vulnerabilities, unsafe accounts, and malicious files. Receive reminders and suggestions and eliminate the risks accordingly.

-  Container runtime security

   Develop a whitelist of container behaviors to ensure that containers run with the minimum permissions required, securing containers against potential threats.
