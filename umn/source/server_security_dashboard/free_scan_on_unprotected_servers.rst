Free Scan on Unprotected Servers
================================

Servers that are not protected by HSS are scanned for free. A security report on their vulnerabilities, unsafe passwords, and asset risks will be generated.

If you need to perform baseline check, application protection, web tamper protection, ransomware protection, intrusion detection, policy management, file integrity detection, and isolation and killing, you can :ref:`enable HSS <hss_01_0260>`.

Free Scan
---------

-  Servers that are not protected by HSS are scanned for free in the early morning on each Monday.
-  A free health check report is generated on the first day of each month. You can only view the report online but cannot download it.
-  In the report, up to five results can be displayed for each check item. If a check item has fewer than five results, only half of them will be displayed.
-  You can purchase HSS to enjoy advanced functions, such as real-time protection, report download, online vulnerability fix, and compliance assistance.
